# Hackathon - Use your UI/UX skills to design your bootcamp landing page

For this hackathon, you'll be using the bootcamp idea we brainstormed during the week.

You'll need to go through the UI/UX process we've been examining this week:

- Review your user stories and user personas from earlier in the week to reorient yourself with your users' needs and the problem you're solving. 
- Review your user journey flow diagram (you can use the [draw.io extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) in VS Code to make this inside the repo).
- Finish your low- and high-fidelity wireframes (using tools like [Miro](https://miro.com/app/) and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)).
- Choose your [Color scheme](https://coolors.co/) - remember, you can create CSS variables to manage things like colors easily! Test your colors for accessibility. Are they still distinguishable for people who are color-blind? Do they have enough [contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)?
- Create a plan that breaks down your design using computational thinking before you start to build your design in this repo. 
  - How are you breaking your page down into components? What is reusable/repeatable? 
  - How are you going to organize your CSS in a way that's consistent, readable, and maintainable? 
  - What CSS variables are you going to use? 
  - Have you considered responsive design and how your page will be viewed on different screen sizes? Are you going to use a tool like CSS flexbox?

Remember to iterate - first, get your users in mind and design looking good. Then build an MVP version - what is the [quickest way you can deliver value](https://www.planview.com/resources/articles/lean-methodology/) and start getting insight? - and then, if you have time, you can consider adding more features.

Really focus on planning, wireframe, design and getting that right, really digging in and spending time in that process. Then when you’re fully happy with what you’ve planned out, you can start creating it with HTML and CSS.

When you’re presenting, our main requirement today is that you can articulate the choices you made with your design and why, keeping the user at the center. Your core requirement is well thought out user stories, user personas, low- and high-fidelity wireframes, and any other information that’s relevant to your plan for your design, so that should be your main focus before iterating with the HTML and CSS.
